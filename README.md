# Lineal

IPA: /ËˆlÉªniÉ™l/

Made up of, or having the characteristic of, lines.

Lineal is a Typst template for generating beautifully clean and configurably awesome slides.

## Philosophy

As a long time user of TeX, I have developed and embedded countless LaTeX applications into personal and corporate environments, e.g. automating documentation, conference materials, posters, resumes, etc.

However, LaTeX is showing its age. Compiling a some 30-slide presentation, for instance, takes perhaps a second, and may requires multiple renders to sync TikZ positioning and cross-document referencing. Typst remediates these issues in real-time and with better control and confidence in its data modelling.

Hence, Lineal was born. A professional set of slides produced near instantly, readily equipped with configurable theming and a suite of flexible components.

## Usage

Lineal is available through Typst Universe. Ensure you have installed Typst locally or are familiar with the Typst [web app](https://typst.app/) or the [Tinymist LSP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist) extensions for VS Code.

### Package API

Get started by importing the package and populating your own `/content/<slug>.typ` files:

```typst
#import "@preview/lineal:0.1.0": lineal-theme

#show: lineal-theme.with(
  aspect-ratio: "16-9",
  config-info(
    title: brand.wordmark,
    subtitle: [A Typst slide template],
    author: [Author],
    date: datetime.today(),
    institution: [Institution],
    logo: brand.logo,
  ),
)

#title-slide()

#include "content/index.typ"
```

Marking up content is as you would with any other Typst document, where the section (`= <section-title>`) and subsection (`== <slide-title>`) shorthands generate the new section slides with dynamic outline and new tracked slides respectively.

### Components

Lineal includes a suite of components that can be used to help lay out and embelish your content.

The `layouts` library is designed to provide a range of layout primitives that solve common layout requirements.

The `components` library offers bespoke UI elements to help add flair to your content, such as a hyperlinked repository language bar, or a quote with a configurable author, or even an IDE-style code block with syntax highlighting.

You can use these in tandem to quickly build a presentation that is both beautiful and functional:

```typst
== Code block

#let pre = "
def hello(name: str) -> None:
    print(f'Hello, {name}!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    hello('Typst')
"

#layouts.page-center(
  code-block(
    filename: "src/app/hello_typst.py",
    language: "python",
    pre,
  )
)
```
